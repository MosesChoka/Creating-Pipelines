Pipelines are a way to keep data preprocessing and modeling organized. Pipelines bundles up the preprocessing and modeling steps to run them as a single command.
Other benefits that come with running pipelines incude:
<ol>
<li>cleaner code
<li>Fewer bugs
<li>Easier to production
</ol>

This repository demonstrate a simple way to develop a pipeline, I use the pipeline to run a RandomForestREGRESSOR. The major steps highighted are;
<ul>
<li>Defining preprocessing stage
<li> Defining the model
<li>Creating and evaluating the pipeline
<ul>
