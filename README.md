Pipelines are a way to keep data preprocessing and modeling organized. Pipelines bundles up the preprocessing and modeling steps to run them as a single command.
Other benefits that come with running pipelines incude:
<li>
<li>cleaner code
<li>Fewer bugs
<li>Easier to production
</li>

In this repository you'll be shown a simple way to develop a pipeline, I use the pipeline to run a RandomForestREGRESSOR. The major steps highighted are;
i) Defining preprocessing stage
ii) Defining the model
iii) Creating and evaluating the pipeline
